The main object oriented concepts are:

    1) Class
    2) object
    3) inheritance
    4) polimorphism
    5) Abstraction
    6) Encapsulation


(1) CLASS :   It is a group of different type of veriable & functions

(2) OBJECT :  It is an instance of class

(3) INHERITANCE :  The object of one class aquire the properties of object
                   of another class is called inheritance

                                                     Or
                   Creating a new class from an existing class is called inheritance

(4) ABSTRACTION :  To hide the data and its working

(5) ENCAPSULATION : To bind a data and its core into a single unit

(6) POLIMORPHISM : One name multiple form

       Type of Polimorphism:  (1) Compiletime Polimprphism (Method Overloading)   
                              (2) Runtime Polimorphism (Method Overriding)


       (1) Method Overloading :  When there is a more than one method in single class
                                 having the same name but with different numbers of
                                 argument and their datatype called a method
                                 overloading

       (2) Method Overriding :  When there is a same method prototype in your both
                                base class and derived class and if you that method
                                using the object of derivrd class then only derived
                                class method will be called, so you can call that
                                method of derived class override the method of base
                                class.
